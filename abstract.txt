= How to Land a Good Go Job

Junior developers often struggle to gain the experience necessary to land their
first job. Companies, on the other hand, desperately look for senior
developers, but are often afraid to hire juniors.

How can we find a middle ground?

In this talk, we'll explore the current market situation, and discuss the types
of knowledge that potential employers value. By dispelling myths and revealing
some oddities, we arrive at an extensive but narrow set of topics, helpful for
companies and developers alike.

Developers will know where to focus to land their first job. Companies will
have a better set of criteria to sharpen their hiring process.

Either way, this talk shows you what really mattersâ€”and how to steer clear of
what doesn't.
